### &emsp;**Description**
#### &emsp; Check the Authenticity of News on Social media. 
#### &emsp; This project aims to provide a solution for verifying the authenticity of news articles shared on social media platforms. By leveraging computer vision techniques and optical character recognition (OCR), the code presented here helps users determine the credibility of news by extracting text from images and comparing it against reliable sources.

#### The project consists of several files written in C++ and utilizes the OpenCV and Tesseract OCR libraries. The main functionalities are divided into four files:

- newsapi.cpp: This file handles the integration with news APIs to retrieve reliable news articles for comparison.
newschecker.cpp: This file contains the core logic for processing images, extracting text, and comparing it with the retrieved news articles.
- UI.cpp: This file is responsible for the user interface, providing an interactive way for users to input images and view the authenticity results.
- main.cpp: This file serves as the entry point to the program, initializing the necessary components and orchestrating the workflow.
